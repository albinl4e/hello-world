# hello-world
Hi Github

It was a newbie exercise for an experienced developer to start github after a long much struggle. I shall keep this github for a long time and would like to do more projects in the following days.

This is my second exercise to test the branch and the pull requests. I have completed the first session and now started trying again with one more example which can help me to be sure on what i have done until now.
